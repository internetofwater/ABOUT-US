# ABOUT-US
Repo for managing ABOUT-US and related projects

The ```Boundaries``` [directory](Boundaries) contains the boundary data for this project and associated documentation. 


## Asks from NC-DENR

1. Create a tool to allow utility managers to update boundaries using either geospatial data uploads or map-based point-and-click polygon editing/drawing. (Probably based on GeoNode or some custom combination of leaflet, GeoGig, PostGIS and Geoserver)

2. A visualization tool to visualize climate data relevant to utilities, where utilities can visualize the status of water supply of their immediate environment and that of thier neighbors. Data flows to consider include:
 - USGS and state and local Stream gages
 - USGS/ State of NC groundwater monitoring wells
 - US Army Corps of Engineers Reservoir operations
 - NOAA weather stations
 - PRISM gridded temperature and precipitation data
 - Utility Conservation Plans and policy status
 
 3. A visualization tool to visualize sociodemographic information relevant to infrastructure cost and affordability. Data flows to consider include
 
  - U.S. Census block-group level income, race, employment, education, renter v owner, SFR/multifamily
  - Prevalence of commercial and industrial facilities (e.g. ReferenceUSA)
  - Water rate data (UNC Environmental Finance Center NC rate dashboard)
